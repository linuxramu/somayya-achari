## 🌟 About the Initiative

**Sommaya Achari Sahaya Nidhi** is a community-driven initiative created to support and care for our beloved **Acharya Ji**.  
This platform was built to ensure **transparency, trust, and accountability** in managing contributions and expenses.  

By providing **live access to funds and expenses through Google Sheets**, every contributor can clearly see:  
- ✅ How much has been contributed so far  
- ✅ How funds are being allocated  
- ✅ Summary of overall support  

This initiative is more than just a financial tracker — it reflects our **commitment to stand together as a community** and keep our word of helping Acharya Ji without interruptions.
